# 01. Study on layout plan of knitting lab

**Date**: 09.07.23

## Introduction

Knitting is the process of making a fabric by interlooping of yarns. The loops are made by a set of needles.

The arrangement or configuration of various machines and facilities in such a way that the production efficiency is maximum, is called layout.

Layout planning is crucial in any manufacturing industry. It's important to ensure the best utilization of space, equipment and manpower. It also helps to reduce the cost of production and increase the productivity.

## Objectives

- To study the plant layout of knitting laboratory.
- To understand the arrangement of machines and equipment.
- To understand the arrangement of raw materials and finished goods.

## Layout

_To be added._

## Specifications
