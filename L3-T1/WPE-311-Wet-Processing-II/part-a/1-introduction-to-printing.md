# Introduction to Printing

After scouring and bleaching process, we get **white fabric**. White fabric is required for printing.

Scouring removes impurities and increase absorbency. Absorbency is required for printing to absorb color.

Bleaching removes the natural yellowish color of fabric. Natural color decreases printing efficiency. Printing color may change due to presence of yellowish effect during printing.

In printing process, color is applied according to design on only specific region. Colored fabric can also be used for printing.

## Solution and Paste

| Solution                                 | Paste                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Used for dyeing. Applied on full fabric. | Used for printing. Applied on only selected region of fabric. |
| Higher amount of solvent present.        | Lower amount of solvent present.                              |
| Spreading property is high.              | Spreading property is low.                                    |
| Less viscosity.                          | High viscosity.                                               |

## Print paste

Any types of dye are mixed with thickener, wetting agents and other chemicals to make print paste.

## Textile Printing

Used for introducing color and design to textile fabric. Designing is not possible with dyeing as the whole fabric is colored.

**Definition of Printing:**

> The localized application of dyes or pigments and chemicals in a paste form by any style and method, produces a particular effect of color on the fabric according to the design is called printing.

Block printing, screen frame etc. are the name various printing methods.

## Identifying Printing

**Step 01:** Check if the whole fabric is colored with same color. If it is colored with the same color, then it is dyed fabric. If it is colored with different color in different region, then process to step 02.

**Step 02:** Multiple color is also possible with weaving. So we have to check if the color is on the both side of the fabric. If the fabric is colored on both sides, then it is a woven fabric. If not, the other side of the fabric is white or unprinted, then it is a printed fabric.

## Objectives of Printing

- To add colors on localized area.
- Introduce various design.
- Allows greater freedom over other systems (like weaving). Less cost and time.
- Inexpensive products.
- Combines art, engineering, dyeing technology to produce images that exist only on a textile designer's mind.

## Various Printing Technology

- Block printing technology
- roller printing technology
- Screen frame printing technology
- Transfer printing technology
  - It was previously used for printing on ceramic items. But now it is also used on fabrics. First, the image is printed on paper. Then transferred to fabric by high pressure and temperature.
- Digital printing technology
