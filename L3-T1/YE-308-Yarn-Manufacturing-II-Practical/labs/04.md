# Study on material passage diagram of breaker card machine

**Date:** 30.07.23

## Introduction

Carding is the most important process in jute spinning. It is the process by which long reeds of jute while passing through high speed pinned rollers are broken down into an entangled mass and delivered into the form of ribbon of unit per weight per unit length. Breaker card machine is the first machine of carding process. It is a half circular down striking machine used for cleaning and straightening of fibers. It is also used for removing impurities from the fibers and making the fibers parallel.

### Breaker card machine tasks

1. Individualization
2. Longitudinal splitting and transversely breaking
3. Removal of impurities
4. Sliver formation

## Objectives

- To know about the working procedure of breaker card machine.
- To be able to sketch the passage diagram of breaker card machine.
- To understand the role of breaker card machine in jute spinning.

## Main Parts

1. Feed sheet
2. Fluted feed roller
3. Cast iron shell
4. Pin feed roller
5. Cylinder
6. Clock pointer
7. Indicator
8. Stripper
9. Worker
10. Doffer
11. Drawing roller
12. Drawing pressing roller
13. Cleaner roller
14. Delivery pressing roller
15. Delivery roller
16. Condenser
17. Roll supporting roller

## Working procedure

## Diagram

## Limitations

1. Many parts could not be drawn properly due to lack of skills.
2. The machine operation could not be observed with actual jute fibers.

## Conclusion

Carding is the process of cleaning and straightening of fibers. Breaker card machine is the first machine of carding process. Breaker card machine is one of the most important machines in jute spinning, used for cleaning and straightening of fibers.

## Notes

- Clock length is the length passed by full rotation of the dial.
- Dollop weight is the weight of the material passed by full rotation of the dial.
- Carding action occurs between cylinder and worker.
- Stripping action occurs between stripper and worker.
- Doffing action occurs between cylinder and doffer.
