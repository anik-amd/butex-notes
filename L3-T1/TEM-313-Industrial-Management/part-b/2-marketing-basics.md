## Why is marketing important?

### The value of marketing

- Financial success often depends on marketing ability.
- Successful marketing builds demand for products and services, which, in turn, creates jobs.
  - For example, bottled water demand in Bangladesh has increased in present compared to past due to building up demand for bottled water.
- Marketing builds strong brands and loyal customer base, which is a major asset for any business.
- MySpace, Yahoo! etc. are replaced by Facebook, Google etc. because of their marketing ability and changing capacity.

## Scope of Marketing

AMA's formal definition of marketing:

> Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

The shortest definition of marketing is _meeting needs profitably_.

## Marketing Management

Peter Drucker says,

> There will always, one can assume, be a need for some selling. But the aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself.

- Marketing management takes place when at least one party to a potential exchange thinks about the means of achieving desired responses from other parties.
