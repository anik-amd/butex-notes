# Cashless Economy: The Impact of Demonetization

## Introduction

A cashless economy is a financial system in which physical currency is largely replaced by digital and electronic transactions. It includes various forms of non-cash payments, such as credit cards, mobile wallets, online banking, and digital currencies.

The transition to a cashless economy is driven by technological advancements, convenience, and the potential for increased financial transparency. It offers benefits like reduced transaction costs, enhanced user-friendliness, and improved security. However, it also raises concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and the impact on those without access to digital resources. The ongoing shift towards a cashless economy has significant implications for finance, commerce, and society.

## The Impact of Demonetization on Cash Usage

The impact of demonetization on cash usage has been profound as this policy intervention, aimed at reducing the circulation of high-denomination currency notes, led to an immediate and significant decrease in the availability of physical cash.

During the adoption, people were compelled to turn to digital and electronic payment methods, leading to a substantial shift in consumer behavior. While the initial disruption caused inconvenience and cash shortages, it accelerated the adoption of digital payments. Post-demonetization, many individuals and businesses continue to rely on electronic transactions, reducing their dependence on cash. This shift has lasting effects on the way financial transactions are conducted, marking a pivotal step towards a cashless economy.

## Technological Advancements and Digital Infrastructure

In the transition towards a cashless economy, robust technological advancements and a well-developed digital infrastructure are required. Technological innovation drives the creation of user-friendly digital payment systems, ensuring secure, efficient, and accessible platforms for financial transactions.

These innovations include mobile banking apps, contactless payment solutions, digital wallets, and blockchain technologies. Simultaneously, a strong digital infrastructure involves high-speed internet access, data security protocols, and reliable connectivity, which underpin the seamless functioning of cashless transactions. Public and private sector collaborations are essential to build and maintain this infrastructure, facilitating the widespread adoption of digital payments, enabling financial inclusion, and promoting economic growth in a modern, cashless economy.

## Global Adoption of Cashless Economy

The global adoption of a cashless economy is on an upward trajectory, transforming the way people and businesses transact worldwide. Driven by the proliferation of smartphones, digital payment systems, and changing consumer preferences, this trend offers significant advantages.

The non-cash transactions growth has increased about 7.8% from year 2019 to 2020. The digital payment systems include Banking Card, Unified Payments Interface, Mobile Wallet, Banks Pre-Paid Cards, Cryptocurrency, and many more.

## Adoption of Cashless Economy in Bangladesh

Cashless payments in Bangladesh have witnessed a notable transformation in recent years. As a country with a predominantly cash-dependent economy, Bangladesh has been making significant strides in embracing digital and cashless transactions. Several key developments have contributed to this shift.

Mobile financial services, particularly through platforms like bKash and Nagad, have become ubiquitous, providing millions of Bangladeshis with access to digital wallets and payment options. The number of users in mobile financial services stood at 191 million at the end of 2022.

The government's commitment to financial inclusion has also played a pivotal role. Initiatives like the National Payment Switch Bangladesh (NPSB) have been introduced to promote interoperability between different financial institutions, making electronic transactions smoother and more accessible. As of 2023, the NPSB is facilitating transactions between 48 banks. [@http://new.standardbankbd.com/ConnectNpsb.php]

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of cashless payments as people sought safer and more convenient ways to conduct transactions. Especially, e-commerce has also experienced a surge, further fueling the need for cashless payment options. The e-Commerce market in Bangladesh surged to Tk 166.16 billion by August of 2020, marking an approximately 29.67-fold increase from the 2016.

While Bangladesh has made significant progress, challenges such as limited internet access in rural areas and the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures still exist. Nevertheless, the country's journey towards a more cashless economy remains promising and reflects a growing awareness of the benefits of digital financial services.

## Challenges Facing the Transition to a Cashless Economy

The transition to a cashless economy, while promising, is not without its challenges. With increased digital transactions, the risk of cyberattacks and fraud escalates, necessitating robust security measures. Privacy concerns also emerge as more personal financial data becomes digital, prompting a balance between convenience and data protection.

Furthermore, ensuring equal access to digital resources for all segments of the population remains a challenge, as some individuals, particularly in remote or underserved areas, may lack the necessary infrastructure or digital literacy. Lastly, the psychological attachment to physical currency can hinder the complete transition. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for a smooth and inclusive shift towards a cashless economy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the evolution towards a cashless economy is an inexorable and transformative journey, reshaping financial landscapes globally. With the rapid growth of mobile financial services, interoperable payment systems, and the burgeoning e-commerce sector, Bangladesh is also moving towards a more digitally connected financial landscape. This shift has enhanced financial inclusion, increased transparency, and reduced the reliance on physical cash.
