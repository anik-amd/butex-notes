## Wet Process

### Washing Chemicals

- Enzyme: Used in enzyme washing & hydrolyses the cellulose to remove color to produce fading effect.
- Detergent: Used in normal wash to remove dirt, dust, sizes and waste materials from garments.
- Acetic Acid ($CH_3COOH$): Neutralize the garments in alkaline condition.
- Anti staining agent
- Bleaching agent: Oxidizing agent.
- Sodium Hyposluphite ($Na_2S_2O_3$): Neutralize the garments in acidic condition.
- Caustic Soda ($NaOH$): Used in caustic wash to remove color from garments.
- Soda Ash($Na_2CO_3$): Creates alkaline medium for the breakdown of pigment dye.
- Sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$): Used in washing plant in the bleach bath with bleaching powder for Denim Light shade because it can easily color fade with in shot time.
- Potassium Permanganate ($KMnO_4$): Used in Acid wash with Pumice stone for color out from the garments.
- Softener: Imparts soft and silky feel.
- Micro emulsion silicon: Gives durable softness, lubricity, elastic handle, anti-pilling.
- Sodium Chloride ($NaCl$): It helps to exhaust dye in to the fiber.
- Buffer: Controls the pH of the bath.
- Hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$): Breaks up and gives some per hydroxhyl ion, which discolor the coloring materials and as a result fading effect is developed.
- Stabilizer: used to protect break of hydrogen peroxide and it works in bath smoothly.
- Fixing agent: Used for unfixed dye to fix on fabrics.
- Optical brightener: used for improve the brightness of garments.
- Resin: Used for the creation of semi-permanent creases in denim and other cellulose fabrics.
- Sodium Meta Bi Sulphite ($Na_2S_2O_5$): Used in the washing plant to neutralized the garment from potassium permanganate.
- Desizing agent

### Objectives

- To remove dust, dirt, oil spot, impurities from the garments.
- To remove size materials from the garments.
- For soft feeling to wear the garments after purchasing.
- To achieve buyer washing standard.

## Enzyme Wash

Enzymes are bio chemical substances that behave as catalysts toward specific reactions.

### Advantages or Objectives of Enzyme Wash

- "Bio-Polishing" effect of cotton/denim.
- Enzyme attack as chemically not mechanically for this reason low damage/wastage.
- For soft feeling to wear the garment. Enzyme attacks more the surface of the fabrics and gives a very smooth surface.
- To remove the size materials from the garments.
- To remove the starch presents on the garments fabrics.
- To achieve the buyer reference sample.
- To increase the color fastness & rubbing fastness.
- Enzyme improves the anti-pilling properties.

### Why Enzyme wash is preferred?

1. Enzyme attacks more the surface of the fabrics and gives a very smooth surface.
2. Enzyme attack as chemically not mechanically for this reason low damage/wastage.
3. Operate at low temperature.
4. Replace harsh chemicals.
5. Eco-friendly.

### Enzyme vs Bleach Wash

## Acid Wash

### Use of Pumice Stone

During Acid wash, pumice stones are used. By the action of pumice stones, irregular fading effect is developed on the heavy garments like denims, thick canvas/twill, and sweater.

The pumice stones act as a brushing action on the garment fabric surface. The area where more brushing action takes place; more discolor or fading effect is developed and the area where less brushing action takes place less fading effect will be developed.

The multi-layer fabric areas like â€“ collar, calf, pocket, placket, side seam etc. area will be brushed more than the single layer areas.
As a result irregular fading affect will be developed on the garments' fabric surface. In this way, fading affect may be developed on the
garments by acid wash technique.

**Usage of KMnO4 with pumice stone:**

Pumice stones are soaked with KMnO4 ; chemical stays on stone surface which give effect.

Without stone only KMnO4 will give uniform fading effect which is not desirable ; for irregular fading stone is used. As in machine, stone comes with surface contact of fabric irregularly & irregular fading is obtained which is desirable.

**Advantages of pumice stone:**

- Desired vintage effect on garments can be easily achieved by using pumice stones.
- Washed garments can achieve more soft effect by using pumice stones.

**Disadvantages of pumice stone:**

- Can be damaged washing machine due to stone and machine abrasion.
- Garments can be damaged due to stone and machine abrasion.

### Objectives:

- Irregular fading.
- Buyer requirement.
- For soft feeling to wear the garments i.e. to improve softness.
- To increase rubbing fastness.
- To remove dust, dirt, oil spot, impurities from the garments.
- To remove size materials from the garments.

### Questions

**Q1: After loading pumice stone why machine runs before loading garments?**

Stone needs to soak with chemical KMnO4; then put in to machine. Before loading garments machine runs so that chemical can spread into
machine uniformly. After that it is ready for operation.

**Q2: Why load garments into another machine?**

Previous machine is filled with KMnO 4 which is an oxidizing agent. It produces fading in fabric. Next step is neutralization ; if same machine is used we need to remove KMnO4 first.
It will be a time consuming process. So use of another machine will be time efficient.

### Factors of Fading

- RPM of machine.
  - More RPM = More fabric surface will be fade.
  - Less RPM = Less fabric surface will be fade.
- Squeeze & pressure (knit)
- Less squeeze bandage ; less chemical ; less effect
- Time
- Concentration

## Caustic Wash

Normally printing on fabric is done after pre-treatment that is desizing, scouring & bleaching.

But for caustic wash, printing is done without pre-treatment.

### Objectives

- To fading/old looking effect on Garment and seam abrasion affection seam area.
- To remove the size materials, starch from the garments.
- Dust, dirt, oil spot, impurities etc. are removed that may come from during process i.e. cutting, stitching and the back process.
- To increase the color fastness & rubbing fastness.
- For soft feeling to wear the garments.
- To increase the hairiness on garments this increases its old look appearance.
- To achieve the buyer reference sample.

## Silicon Wash

Silicon washes are generally done on all type of fabrics.

### Objectives

- It gives durable softness, elastic handle,
- It helps to anti pilling affects, dimensional stability, tear resistance.
- It helps to fabrics to be cut and sewn more easily allows.
- Improve wears and easy care properties.

## Super White Wash

_To be added._

## Washing Parameter/Condition

![](./img/washing-parameter.png)

## Washing Faults

- Bleach spot
- Over grinding
- Shade variation
- Crease mark
- After wash hole
- Poor brightness
- Poor handfeel
- High low effect
- High hairness
- Over blasting
- Spot on garments
- Bad smell due to poor neutralization

## Prevent of back staining

- Use limited softener
- Use anti-staining agent
- Use better dye
