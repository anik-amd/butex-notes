title: 3. Batching
---

In the jute yarn manufacturing, batching refers to all the preparatory steps undertaken before the carding of jute fibre.

## Objects of Batching

_Or, importance of batching_

- To help the fiber movement freely during processing.
- To get expected dampness and flexibility.
- To reduce hardness or stiffness.
- To control and reduce the yarn cost.
- To reduce waste.
- To intermix the batch component effectively.
- To produce improve graded yarn.

## Piecing out

Opening of jute bale and separation of stiff root jute and making of _morah_ according to specific weight (1-2 lb) is called piecing out.

## Emulsion

- **Emulsion:** Mixture of two immiscible liquids where one is dispersed in small globules, on the other hand addition of a third substance brings stability.
- Water, oil and emulsifier are the ingredients for a batching emulsion.
- **Jute Batching Emulsion:** A mixture of some lubricating agents which is applied on jute fiber to make the fiber soften and flexible.

### General recipe

- Water: 73%
- Oil: 25.4%
- Emulsifier: 1.6%

### Functions of elements of emulsion

- **Function of oil:**
  - It lubricates the fibre.
  - It helps fibre to move freely during processing.
  - It makes the fibre soft and gives more spinning property.
  - It cleans the pins and rollers of the machine.
- **Function of water:**
  - It increases extensibility of fibre which resists fibre breakage during processing.
  - It gives sufficient dampness and flexibility to the fibre.
- **Function of emulsifier:** Emulsifier is a surface active agent. These are soaps, detergents, wetting agents, etc.
  - It removes temporary hardness of water.
  - It helps emulsion to remain in stable form.
  - It reduces surface tension.
  - It makes droplet formation easier.
  - It stabilizes the emulsion.
  - It prevents separation of oil from water.
- **Function of urea:**
  - It helps easy penetration of emulsion into the fibre.
  - It helps fibre to be soft quickly.
  - It reduces maturity time to half.

### Requirements of elements of emulsion

- **Requirements of emulsifier:**
  - It must not impair the lubricating properties.
  - It should not have objectionable color and odor.
  - It should be chemically inert with fiber.
  - Moisture regain should be less than 30%.
  - It should have good wetting properties.
- **Requirements of water:**
  - It should be soft (free from CO, Mg, Fe etc.)
  - Hard water should be treated before using.
  - It should be colorless and odorless.
  - It should be free from suspended mineral.
  - It should be acceptable.

### **Reasons/Objectives of using emulsion:**

- To make soft fiber.
- To increase cohesiveness,
- Pliability increase,
- To increase flexibility,
- To make spinning satisfactory,
- To make the fiber suitable for carding,
- To give twist and easy movement.
- To avoid stiffness.

## Pilling/Conditioning

- The process by which after applying emulsion jute fiber is stored at a specific condition for certain time is called pilling.
- **Objects:**
  - To soften and split up of jute fiber,
  - To loosen the fiber,
  - To convert the rooty material into spinnable fiber.
