# üëã Hello There

I'm Anik Ahmed, student of [B.Sc. in Textile Engineering (Specialized in Fabric Engineering)](https://www.butex.edu.bd/) at [Bangladesh University of Textiles](https://www.butex.edu.bd/). I'm currently in Level 3, Term 1. I'm also a self-taught programmer and a hobbyist writer. I love to learn new things and share them with others. I'm also a big fan of open-source and open-access. I believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone. That's why I'm sharing my notes and resources on textile engineering publicly.

This website has syllabus, notes on class lectures, question banks, suggestions and other resources for surviving through the B.Sc. in Textile Engineering (Specialized in Fabric Engineering).

# Why TexNx?

I've stopped looking for `unique` domain ideas long time ago. Don't know if it's due to lack of creativity or the internet got too big to find a good domain which is not taken by some random dude.

My approach to find a domain idea is to just pick random letters related to the subject and squish them together to make something that simply makes no sense. That's how I came up with `TexNx`. Here, `Tex` is obviously `Textile` & `Nx` is (almost) `Notes`.
